# Risk Calculator
A fine grained application security risk calculator for MacOS X written in Objective C. 

This is what we use at Threat Intelligence to rate risks. It's loosely based upon the OWASP Risk Methodology, but has
some allowances for OSTMM 3 isms, such as attack chaining. 

So no more guessing if stored XSS is really a big deal, calculate it!
